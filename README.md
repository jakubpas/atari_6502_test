# Atari 6502 Mads Assembler Test

The game is using Player/Missile graphics. Sprites movement / joystick control / collision detection and so on is done 
in main program loop not IRQ is used so far. 
The delays are simply generated by additional loops. ANTIC DLI program is used to display scores in first lines of 
graphics memory. The scores are kept binary but displayed by using 6502 decimal mode. No nested subroutines to avoid
stack overflow. Whole code can fit in just two memory pages. Page 0 is used for storing some values to speed up transfer 
to registers and accumulator.

## Requirements:

 - MADS Assembler
 - Atari800 emulator
 - Tested on Atari 130 XE hardware
- [Idea with 6502 plugin](https://github.com/mike42/6502-assembly-intellij)
- My [Number convertert plugin](https://github.com/jakubpas/number_converter)

(I'm aware of [WUDSN IDE](https://github.com/peterdell/wudsn-ide) which is great, but I still like Idea better)

## Idea External tools configuration:

- Set working dir to $FileDir$

- Compile:

```
./local/bin/mads $FilePath$ -o:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.xex -p -t:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.lab -l:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.lst
```

- Run:

```
/usr/bin/xterm -iconic -e atari800 -run $FileNameWithoutExtension$.xex
```
